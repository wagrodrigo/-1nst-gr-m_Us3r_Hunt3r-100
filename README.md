##Notes

- Compile errors show in the Output window, not the error list window.
- The solution configuration manager defaults to NOT build clojure projects. To correct this, right-click on the solution, choose Configuration Manager, and check the "build" box next to your clojure projects.
- The vsClojure installer should have stored the core framework directory in the VSCLOJURE_RUNTIMES_DIR environment variable pointing to C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\VisualStudio\[version]\Extensions\[randomCharacters]\Runtimes\
